## Retrospective

## Challenges

### Apple Watch Ring Challenge

### Blogging Challenge

### Reading Challenge


I told myself that I wanted to get back on track with the hobbies and activities which would better my outlooks and experiences, one of the most popular ways being reading. In 2019, I started off with a challenge of reading 20 books and recorded 12 books before I lost interest to shiny toys and other distractions, so instead of committing to what seems to be a modest goal, I decided to challenge the concept of dedicated time for reading instead. My challenge which I have at the time of writing the blog post have maintained for the most part, was to read for at least twenty minutes per day where possible. This was easily translated to my commute, which used to consist of Podcast listenings while browsing Reddit and Twitter -a side effect of having to lose the podcasts for the book; I now need to find a time to supplement my favorite podcasts.

This January, I opted to finish reading _The Art of Possibility_ which I was half-way through at the start of the new year. It's a fantastic book, one which by that half-way point, I had already bought spare copies of to distribute to those I believe would enjoy the read as I did. After, I undertook the long anticipated _The Unicorn Project_, the follow-up to _The Phoenix Project_ by Gene Kim which I aim to have completed before the start of February. Needless to say, hearing the ravings of those I highly regard such as [John Fish](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrFish235/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) and [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjR9lz-R1xk) also provided the "self improvement concepts" boost of motivation I needed to resume my old reading habits. I remember going through entire book series back in highschool, often scaring the librarian how quickly I was checking in and out various texts. Fun times!
