## Retrospective

2020 has been off to quite the unsettling start, between the wildfires that burn through Australia, the recent passing of Neil Peart and Kobe Bryant, World War III concerns being raised in much louder voices than a fearful whisper, etc. Yet, I wanted to touch upon some of the items that I was working with in attempts to better myself in the first month of 2020. 

## Challenges

Typically, everyone sets New Year's resolutions which are held with great care for the first month or few, and then quickly dropped; often due to the goal being unsustainable or too close to a chore. I fell into this cycle many times, and decided that I wanted to approach my goals as smaller monthly-challenges, similar to Matt D'Avella's own. By limiting each challenge to a month, I'm able to make the scope smaller and also accomodate time / priority shifts that are expected to appear just as things begin to make sense.

For January, I wanted to jump-start the challenges with three which each focused on an aspect of life that I wanted to improve in a small way (to start). The three were health, reading, and blogging. 

### Apple Watch Ring Challenge

### Blogging Challenge

In 2017, I became a blogging-monster purely to spread some thoughts I wanted to share, along with appease my Open Source (OSD600, SPO600) classes which provided marks for "showing your work" through blog posts. I realied in 2017, that with the proper motiviationa and drive that I loved technical blogging. The abililty to share intellectual information and troubleshooting along with the embarrassing failure stories and remorses was a medium that I relished in; being more accessible than the YouTuber / vlogger style of content deliver being a major plus. In the years to follow, though I enjoyed blogging the frequency of content and (in my opinion) qualitly started to dwindle. Posts came once a month at best, some being released  months apart on average. It was a phase of "just get it released". It became a chore that I lost interest in at the time, often putting off any time I could spend on blogging to other mindless activities. 

For January, I told myself that I wanted to revisit blogging, but with a different perspective which would instead of challenging the constant release cycle of content, I would write about items that I was working with in my daily job and interests with the intent of releasing the article in the first few days of the next week. Where this differs is in the approach, once which I think enabled this challenge: attempt to blog for 20 minutes a day where possible. Instead spending an entire day on an article, I'd split it up among the days to make it more accessible in this busy world we find ourselves in. The 20-min a day writing idea allowed me to schedule [often at the end of the day while I was winding down] dedicated time for writing, which became a habit that felt more of a hobby than chore or requirement, and it allowed me to also publish a new post every Monday of January so far!

### Reading Challenge

I told myself that I wanted to get back on track with the hobbies and activities which would better my outlooks and experiences, one of the most popular ways being reading. In 2019, I started off with a challenge of reading 20 books and recorded 12 books before I lost interest to shiny toys and other distractions, so instead of committing to what seems to be a modest goal, I decided to challenge the concept of dedicated time for reading instead. My challenge which I have at the time of writing the blog post have maintained for the most part, was to read for at least twenty minutes per day where possible. This was easily translated to my commute, which used to consist of Podcast listenings while browsing Reddit and Twitter -a side effect of having to lose the podcasts for the book; I now need to find a time to supplement my favorite podcasts.

This January, I opted to finish reading _The Art of Possibility_ which I was half-way through at the start of the new year. It's a fantastic book, one which by that half-way point, I had already bought spare copies of to distribute to those I believe would enjoy the read as I did. After, I undertook the long anticipated _The Unicorn Project_, the follow-up to _The Phoenix Project_ by Gene Kim which I completed just this past weekend. Needless to say, hearing the ravings of those I highly regard such as [John Fish](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrFish235/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) and [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjR9lz-R1xk) also provided the "self improvement concepts" boost of motivation I needed to resume my old reading habits. I remember going through entire book series back in highschool, often scaring the librarian how quickly I was checking in and out various texts. Fun times!
