_Despite my constant drift to different technologies, operating systems and languages (which, to be fair is rather natural with the given task, ever-changing preferences, etc), I've found the motivation and drive behind has never changed. So I decided to write about it._

Let's get the obvious (in my mind at least) out of the way first.

## Future Opportunities

I was incredibly confident that a career choice in software development and computing would not go to waste. It was a complete 180 compared to my original career goals, which was social work and psychology. But, we'll get more into that later in the article.

Here's my logic for the 180:

- My father was a software developer on Bay St.
- I've probably broken, my family computer at least a dozen times per year since 2005.
- By breaking that computer, I also learned how to repair and improve it...
- I eventually installed every operating system under the Sun, including MacOS Leopard / Hackingtosh, Ubuntu 4.04, and even Open Suse.

By the last point, I had developed quite a basic understanding of computers, scripting, the terminal, and also logic. So, when looking at the current day (2013-2014 era), I saw the advantage of jumping on the evolution bandwagon at the right time. I saw mobile applications, cloud computing and open-source becoming a staple in the background forces which truly defined our 2010s, and also a career of budding opportunity. With my computer experience, it only made sense to follow in my dad's footsteps and pursue the world of software development... plus I liked tinkering, and was drawn to the shiny specks of bits and nerdiness which put me into a different table in the high school cafeteria.

## Introducing, the Smartphone!

I watched Phil of the Future, Kim Possible, and a whole bunch of shows which I'd argue easily outclass the current programming for kids, and many of these shows had a technological component that the main characters would interact with, a pocket computer / smart communicator. Since seeing those used in such fantastical (and 99% sci-fi worth) ways, I saw the future. Or, I should say I defined them in my youthfulness as the future. It was amazing. This concept was not limited to cartoons and kid shows either, you could find dozens of examples of such devices and concepts in popular culture, science fiction, and Star Trek.

I was too young to appreciate the iPhone launch itself, and spent the next year discovering who the "rich families" were in my school as generation one iPhone's started to become known in the small high school hallways; gleaming and looking utterly premium compared to the Blackberry and starter flip phones which still utilized T-9 texting. When the "App Store" was released, that's when Apple (and Google's answer: Android) got my attention.
