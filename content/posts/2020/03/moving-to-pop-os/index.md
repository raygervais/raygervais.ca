## The One Year Experiment

Around the begining of 2019, I opted to use Windows 10 as the only operating system on my desktop -an unheard-of choice for those who know me best. My outlook on the challenge could be summed up into the following thought questions and points:

- Well, I'll finally be able to game with the roommates (windows-exclusive games...) and bond with them through this.
- Let's see how Windows 10 feels after four years of updates and feature releases.
- How hard could it be, given that Microsoft has been pushing for better developer support, tooling, and "openness" under Satya's direction?
- Is this the year that I'll adopt and learn Powershell as my primary shell? -No, I'll answer that one right now and say that I didn't get the chance to learn PowerShell.
- Will I be more productive in this environment compared to my \*Nix environments?
- Am I capable of accepting that a fresh clean install of Windows 10 came with Netflix, Candy Crush, and Dolby Audio preinstalled? -No. Never will be able to accept this.

As of this past weekend, which marked the start of March and what appears to be kinder climates, I opted to conclucde the one year experiment and evaluate the state of the Linux desktop in comparison for a month. Though Windows itself wasn't giving much grief, there were still workflows and quirks that I truly never got over; likewise developing with WSL 2.0 proved to be quite the abstract objective than I thought which led to quite a bit of productivity-loss. I still quite enjoy the concept of Windows Subsystem for Linux, and feel that if I had started using it from day one instead of droping it into a prexisting `GIT-BASH` setup that things would be quite smoother. Infact, I have plans to test exactly that If I end up returning to Windows 10 in the near future.
