_Warning: I have no clue what I'm doing, but it seemed pretty enticing after months of playing around._

## Why a JAMStack?

I decided to depart from the tried-and-true LAMP stack (powered WordPress of course) for what appears to be the future of websites, the allure of the shiny and new: JavaScript, Apollo, Markdown. In truth, the later is what truly got me interested in committing to such as stack; editing a post like such as this one in Markdown simply feels ten times better, even compared toWordPress' admittedly fantastic modern editor. Throughout my note-taking life cycles, I've always opted for the ones which supported Markdown and allowed for file exports in the same format _-my logic being that the data itself should be accessible both inside and outside the application (OneNote, please learn from this!), in the case that I also need to switch applications or provide a portable format to friends, colleagues, etc_.

Furthermore, the idea of modern JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS and React being utilized to power a-more-static HTML-than-SPA front-end ensured that modern development lessons wouldn't hinder performance or result in a 2010's web experience. Who remembers querying the server for every URL click and reloading the page? _Yuck_. Having learned VueJS in the past year, the chance to use it in the context of a non-web-application context (as opposed to a web site) seemed incredible. My past experience as a MEAN stack developer means that I'm more familiar developing both websites and application in the platform compared to modifying WordPress themes; This is a different canvas, with a different brushstroke requirement.
