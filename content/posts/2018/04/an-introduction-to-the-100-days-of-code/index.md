description: "The day has finally come, the start of the much discussed 100 days of code! The official website can be found here: 100daysofcode.com, which explains the methodologies and why(s) of the challenge. I decided that it would be the best way to start learning new languages and concepts that I've always wanted to have experience in, such as `Python`, `Swift`, `Rust`, and `GoLang`. The first and primary scope is to learn Python, and have a comfort with the language similar to how I do with C and C++."

The day has finally come, the start of the much discussed 100 days of code! The official website can be found here: 100daysofcode.com, which explains the methodologies and why(s) of the challenge. I decided that it would be the best way to start learning new languages and concepts that I've always wanted to have experience in, such as `Python`, `Swift`, `Rust`, and `GoLang`. The first and primary scope is to learn Python, and have a comfort with the language similar to how I do with C and C++.

## Expectations & Challenges

I'm not nervous at all with the idea of learning Python, but I'm concerned with being able to do an hour of personal programming daily at a consistent rate. Being realistic, right now I still spend three hours commuting on bus and trains, crowed to the degree where it's not viable to even program on a Tablet or Netbook. These coding hours I imagine will be affiliated with the later hours, since I am no morning person.

I also expect to become rather well acquainted with Python 3 within a week or few, and have begun thinking of ways to further my development with the language by using or contributing to python projects such as Django, Home-Assistant, Pelican, and Beets for example. This will vary or expand as we get further into the process.

Once content, I want to move to Swift and relearn what I had previous did in the Seneca iOS Course, attempting to further my understanding and building applications in the same time. I think the end result being a iOS application with a Python back end would be a beautiful ending, don't you agree? We'll see.

## Here We Go

I cannot say that I will blog everyday for the challenge, but instead will try my hardest to keep those interested through my twitter handle @GervaisRay. Furthermore, you can keep track of my progress [here](https://github.com/raygervais/100-days-of-code-challenge) where I'll attempt to update the week's README with relevant context and thoughts.

This will be fun, and I can't wait to see how I, and my peers do throughout the challenge.
