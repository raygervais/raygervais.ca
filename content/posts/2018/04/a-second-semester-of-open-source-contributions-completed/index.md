It's hard to believe how quickly this semester has come to a close. Some of us including me even had countdown calendars, and yet the days escaped even quicker than we could count. It feels like just last week I started my second dedicated foray into Open Source technologies, and yet in the next two weeks it'll be the end of such adventure (for now, that is). Similar to what I did when I completed OSD600, I thought I'd recap and share my thoughts as I complete OSD700, and perhaps also allude to the progression and experiences between the two which is only possible through fantastic instructors such as David.

## From 600 to 700

### The Rise of JavaScript

In David's OSD600, I learned quite a bit about modern-day JavaScript practices and how they applied to current Open Source trends. Looking back now, I gather a few reasons why JavaScript completely swept over and took the FOSS realm by storm:

- Thanks to Electron and HTML, making cross platform desktop applications is now as simple as writing a web application. I believe this is imperative in the popularity of JavaScript applications since working with GTK, qt, WPF, and Cocoa (just to name a few) can be disjointed and utterly mind jarring at times. If you know HTML and CSS, your application can share unified styling and components on all major platforms.
- JavaScript has grown in the past decade to be one of the most flexible languages I've ever seen. Learning advanced JavaScript development means learning new patterns, new paradigms, new programming concepts such as callback / closure centric logic wrappers, and with the addition of Node for the backend, a semi-robust alternative to the languages of yesterday.
- I've observed a radical shift both from SOTI and from developers I've talked to regarding their change of perspective between dynamically typed, interpreted languages such as Python, JavaScript and compiled languages such as C#, C++, and Java. Many whom admitted disdain for JavaScript were now advocating its usefulness for prototyping and rapid application development without the need to compile or grand environments being provisioned. Of course, you have individuals in both camps, some who claim that NODE and JavaScript are still too immature to be taken so seriously in enterprise, of which I do see some their points being incredibly realistic. Tried True > Bleeding Edge.

### From Student to Intern

Likewise, it was through learning JavaScript in OSD600 that I had the confidence to learn Angular and it's primary language, TypeScript. From there, the entire MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) JavaScript centric stack and all of it's toil and glory. Flash forward three months later, and this new experience actually landed me into my first enterprise Internship with SOTI Inc, where I was a front end Angular developer. Using David's knowledge and lessons, I learned quickly how to excel and push forward the tasks much bigger, much more complex than my potential, and became the lead front-end developer (still an intern!) of the SOTI Insight team.

I don't think a single day goes by where OSD600 hasn't had an impact on my current work in the best way. Looking back now, without that class I can say that I would not be in the position I came to, nor would I have the experience and drive which came from that class.

### The Transitioning to 700, Thoughts Post-600

The same can be said for many who took David's OSD600, and for those who in OSD700 are also finding their callings. With 700, instead of being shown around the nest and how various communities work we were thrown directly into the sky, told to choose a place to land and from there build our own nests alongside the given communities we chose. Here, some chose Visual Studio Code, Brave, Chart.JS, Angular.Material, ngx-bootstrap, Python even!

The experiences differ per person, but I don't *think* any of us walked out with less than when we walked in. Instead, we walk into the last few classes with contributions and pull requests to our name, a steady stream of work relating to us showing up on most search engines at the very top (talk about good publicity for a developer!), and a confidence and skill set which isn't easily obtained that will push our careers further than ever before.

## Lessons and Thoughts Which Stood Out This Semester

### Debugging through Different Directions

I've written about some of the debugging methods I've painstakingly learned over the past four years, a post which was directly inspired by David's lessons and articles on the topic. Being the ever-learning, humbly experienced developer that he is, David shared with us his strategies for debugging applications built on top of the Electron framework; a lesson which the very next day even affected the nature of my tasks at SOTI in the best possible way.

Whereas I discussed in my post a lot of the common debugging issues and or missed areas which younger students that I tutored or myself often struggle with, David went straight into explaining how to bend Chrome and modern technologies to our will. He explained `Dogfooding`, Dependency Injection concepts, and navigating your way around a huge code base looking for a single event listener using modern day tools. Never before had I looked at the Chrome DevTools specifically with such admiration of what was possible through a web browser. It's amazing how much effort and work is put into such tools and applications that the everyday person will never think about nor discover.

I took some of the tricks that David had displayed and applied it next day while debugging an item at SOTI. To my disbelief, no one else on the development team (which at that time was comprised of 4 senior JavaScript developers, 6 software developers) had heard of the debugging-on-DOM-Node-event trick, or even conditional breakpoints accessible through Chrome's DevTools. Yet, it was exactly these two tricks (plus a few others) which finally allowed me to discover the flaw in the code; the line which broke the business logic.

### Becoming a Small Community in The Class

Throughout most of our courses, we're always anticipating to make friends in the classes we frequent and build relationships or networking potential with our peers. This means that when we see each other in the halls while rushing towards the next test, we'll nod, see how it's going, strike a conversation, or perhaps press forward since the Prof isn't going to wait for you. I found this scenario through my few years at Seneca to be very predictable, to be the standard of meeting individuals who are in the same field as you.

In OSD600, and even more so in 700, I found David guided us towards something much bigger and more concrete. As per his intention, the class of OSD700 became a community where thoughts, stories, events and coding struggles were shared and enjoyed. Interesting developments or thoughts were shared on the Slack channel weekly, often by Sean who somehow managed to always have a new link or article to share! We attended a Rangle.IO event as a portion of the class, and even got to tour the Mozilla Toronto Office (MoTO) with Michael Hoye. The twitter tag #SenecaSocksCrew was created initially as a chance to get awesome looking VueJS socks, but later kept alive to become a symbol. An anchor for all of us to come back and relate to, to keep in touch and also to plan out new events together after the semester ends.

David got what he wanted, which was to join a class of extraordinary people into our own open source community. The community at the moment consists of the following incredible developers, who I'd recommend looking into for both their work, their blogs, and their continued plans to change the world:

### Presenting your Best and Worst Work

[![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504992963429-56f2d62fbff0?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=237d8574a6354ecc190cb611aedff03e&dpr=1&auto=format)](https://unsplash.com/@tavi004) This is an interesting one, because as the title suggests some days aren't meant for presenting the goldmine of work you produced. Instead, we were encouraged to present any and all of it. What this meant was explaining our thinking, our trials and where we want to go next with the task at hand.

This was one topic which took me away from the comforts of a polished end result. Never before have I had to talk about failures, and work in progress to such degree, admitting that at the time of your presentation that there is still work to do, things to fix, and a long road ahead. It took a lot of time for me to adjust, to admit alongside my pampered and finished tasks that some were the polar opposite, coal in a cave full of unknown code waiting to break or be found. It was incredibly stress-inducing to me to go up in front of my peers, and explain why an item isn't working, similar to a progress report. I've always been a perfectionist, so the introduction of this style of presenting was one which pulled me very left field, but also gave me the slowly-worked-to chance to learn from the presentation style and own up to the tasks in their unfinished entirety.

### Contributing To the Everyday Persons Workflow

This title seems odd, even for me who wrote it. What I really mean by this, is that our contributions should be aimed at making the biggest splash it can for others. This doesn't mean sending thousands of lines of code changes in a single Pull Request, instead it means making the project one bug less, one language translated more, one requested feature added, etc. David really tried to emphasize this as many of us looked at lines of code as the metric between an 'A' and 'B' graded release, instead of how this 'very small' change would improve the workflow of developers all over the world using said project, or how this bug fix will help clients and developers alike to push the project forward by removing technical debt for example.

It took awhile for me to learn this, since previous courses and egos always considered the better programmer to be the one who writes quality code, in bountiful amounts. My first few fixes were mere line changes, which though they qualified as a ‘release’, to me they felt like the shortest fragment of a ‘patch’. Over time, this changed as David stressed how these fixes were improving the lives of both the users and developers, beit bug fixes, new features, or even accessibility improvements (my niche I suppose). I saw that contributing didn’t have to be verbose, but instead helpful.

## Where Do I Want To Go From Here

This isn't my last blog post, nor is it my last blog post relating to OSD700. But, I figured this would be a nice place to put my ambitions and thoughts towards how I want to steer 2018. Not in any order of priority or execution:

\- Learn VueJS / React - Learn Python 3, Rust, GoLang - Write a Full Stack Web Application from the Ground Up - Write a Mobile Application from the Ground Up (iOS? Android?) - Become a Mozillian! - Become a Node Certified Developer - Become a Linux Certified Administrator (maybe?!) - Continue contributing to FOSS communities - Continue working on Musical Adventures, release some of it! - Continue being a member of the SenecaSocksCrew community

Going forward, I’m hoping to learn more lessons and also expose myself to newer technologies which contrast or conflict with my own current experiences and vices, my logic being that it will round me out as a programmer better than falling into a specific niche. I imagine my new career title will play well with this concept, going from Front-end Developer to Cloud Platform Engineer. 2018 is only a quarter of the way through, and there is still much that is possible before we see the end.
