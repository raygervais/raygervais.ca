With the start of the new year, and a semester which contains a promising set of courses that many are excited for, it's appropriate that open source technologies have become the leading topic of this semester. OSD600 and SPO600 aim to guide us on many topics related to open source platforms, and promise that our contributions will benefit the everyday consumer in a variety of ways. With open source, the opportunities to shape the upcoming state of technology are endless, allowing us to contribute to the source code which will make up 2017.
