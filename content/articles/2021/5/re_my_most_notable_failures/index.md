_Remember when response videos where a thing? Here's mine:_

So this week, Mr James Inkster (grommers) himself graced us with the first look into his thoughts for the past year in the form of a blog post titled, My Most Notable Failures. It was a damn good read; full of honesty and admitance not to actually making mistakes, but realizing that there's still so much more learning to do. That's how I interpreted many of the points he had raised, even going so far to say that by Breaking Linux by following random instructions online, he was truly becoming a real software developer by learning both how to break and fix your development environment. I then reminded him of the countless times that I had messed up my systems to the point beyond repair over the years and how it backtracked me less and less each time.

I was also inspired by the topic, because it contributes to a theme which I believe is long overdue: normalizing failure. In the spirit of sharing my own and continuing the trend, here's my response-esque post with a few of my own.

## You're Not Impressed by my Niche Terminal Theme? Doesn't It Make Me More Productive?

If I were to list off the amount of themes I've tried and switched on any common day, it would scare you. It's not even that I'm trying to color match my entire system ala Dracula or anything like that! 

## Favoring Skill over People

The more and more I dig into my career, the more I've been forced to see an honest truth, I'm quite cold and methodical at times. It's a flaw that I've heard originates within my family tree and also plagues some of the more kind-hearted in that same tree. In my mind, my tone [topic depending] was never personal. It derived from the idea that skill, focus, understanding and ingenuity had to be targeted and upheld in the teams I was apart of. You say you learn this or that? Fantastic. I can't wait to see what you'll do with it. You say you don't ever think about better ways to do a task? Well, looks like your kind stories and jokes won't get us far.

Now, I can also admit that I've learned and grown thanks to my peers, teachers, and collegues who have distilled their own approaches to working with (and on) people. It feels good to say that I've lightened up and also been inspired by those who approach their interactions in the perspective of "how can I enable you?" Dave said he focuses on the human element of the project, and I believe I'm starting to see the natural heartbeat and rhythm of a team who's learning together; enabled and lifted by each other. Fear not fellow reader and potential collegue or team member, I'm not nearly as bad as this may read. I hope. Luckily, I'm on a pretty well balanced team where the cold-methodical thinkers gets well balanced with the warm-hearted.

## Not Knowing What I Want To Do

So I wrote about [why I got into Software Development and Information Technology last year](https://raygervais.dev/articles/2020/03/why-i-got-into-programming/), which stemmed down to the theme of reaching as many people as I could. My idea orbited the landscape of Mobile Application development because who doesn't have a smartphone in 2016? 2018? 2020? 2021? It didn't have to be a new application trending on the App/Play Stores either. It was simply the idea of reaching as many people in the most meaningful way that I could do as someone who favors technology in their career. The problem was, when I was granted the opporunity to take my first step and build a "career" from it, I didn't know which to take. 

Sure, I could study a lot more and perhaps get in at an Android or iOS Shop -that surely sounds like something most logical given what I stated above, but yet I was also faced with the lingering doubt of "is this what you really want?". By that time, I was well deep into my Linux understanding for an individual in their early 20s and also well-enough versed in Web Development at the time to convince a cynical prof that I could leverage a MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular and React) stack for our final project. There were a few different paths at my feet. After completing my second internship under the guise of a Web Developer, I found an rock I could leap to which brought a new career path opportunity: Cloud Engineering. The rock? My skills with Linux and Software Development tooling. Even after being a Cloud Engineer for three years which includes learning fantastical technologies of new and old -all of which, are typically oblivious to the system and medium they're hosted on-, you can imagine my own surprise when that same question arrives even at the most normal of times.

Does this sound familiar? I know almost every one of my peers and friends I've talked to have had similar tug-a-wars with their ideas and implementations. In my case, I see this as a failure purely because I opted to follow doors and stairwells as they appeared instead of focusing on a single path that a younger me had believed was best. But, since when did we know better when younger? Even with the self-doubt, I've learned to not beat myself up over things that I could still persue if the interest is there; and likewise I cannot deny either the fantastic career experience I've been exposed by playing this game of snakes and ladders.

## Fighting The System In the Vain of New and Shiny

- Fighting Ruby, Legacy languages
- Refusing to improve legacy, instead advocating for total rewrites in a modern stack

## Taking on too much, burning out beyond repair

- Telescope, Microservices, Work, Music, Relationships, Pandemic.
